					<p>OSS 2025 is committed to providing a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for all conference participants and the OSS 2025 planning committees and volunteers. This Code of Conduct applies to all interactions between presenters, attendees, and the conference planning committees within the Zoom virtual sessions, Slack, and any other conference activities, correspondence, or attendance (prior, during, and/or after the conference). As a participant in this conference, it is expected that you follow Zoom etiquette while inside any Zoom rooms associated with the conferences. OSS 2025 will not tolerate harassment in any form. We use the definition of harassment from the <a href = "http://bit.ly/coc4lib" target = "_blank">Code4Lib Code of Conduct</a> to include:</p>

						<p><i>Any behavior that threatens or demeans another person or group, or produces an unsafe environment. It includes offensive verbal comments or non-verbal expressions related to gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religious or political beliefs; sexual or discriminatory images in public spaces (including online); deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</i></p>

						<p>If you experience harassment or hear of any incidents of unacceptable behavior, OSS 2025 asks that you either make an anonymous report or a personal report as follows:</p>
						
						<ul>
						<li>Anonymous Report: You can make an anonymous report through <a href = "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf3yoK8UeLQYRCEZvFhClyp16Up1iOrHNHkYPeSj1EE33auiQ/viewform" target = "_blank">this form</a>. Because of the anonymity, we cannot follow up on this report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.</li>
						<li>Personal Report: You can make a personal report by contacting <a href = "ebongiov&#64andrew.cmu.edu" target = "_blank">Emily Bongiovanni</a>. All information from your report will be kept secure and only shared with conference organizers if needed for mediation. Please be sure your report contains the following (sharing only as much information as you feel comfortable): your name, the name of the person/people you are reporting, details of the incident (day, time, place, etc.), any other information we need to know in order to take necessary action, and anything we can immediately do in order to protect your mental health and/or physical safety.</li>
						
						<p>OSS 2025 reserves the right to take any action deemed necessary and appropriate, including immediate removal from the meeting without warning, in response to any incident of unacceptable behavior, and OSS 2025 reserves the right to prohibit attendance at any future meeting, virtually or in person.</p>
